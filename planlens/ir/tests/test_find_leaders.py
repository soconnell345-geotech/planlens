"""find_leaders (B5-leaders) recall/precision on synthetic PDF-vector sheets.

Uses planlens.ir.tests.leader_fixtures (programmatic PyMuPDF sheets with
planted leaders + decoy geometry: a dimension line whose arrowheads are
geometrically near-identical to a leader arrowhead, stray unlabelled lines,
an isolated small closed shape, a numbered detail-bubble circle). Numbers are
measured and asserted honestly -- if the heuristic does not achieve perfect
precision at confidence 0, that is reported, not hidden.
